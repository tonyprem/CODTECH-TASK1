Overview of the Project

Project:LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO

Objective

Design and implement a simple circuit using an Arduino microcontroller to control the blinking of an LED. The project aims to demonstrate basic microcontroller programming skills, circuit design, and understanding of digital output control using Arduino. The LED will blink at regular intervals, with the ability to modify the blinking speed through code adjustments.

Key Activities

Understand Basic Electronics: Learn the fundamentals of working with electronic components like LEDs, resistors, and breadboards.

Learn Arduino Programming: Write a simple Arduino program (sketch) using the Arduino IDE to control the blinking of an LED.

Understand Digital Output Control: Explore how to use digital output pins to control components.

Modify Blinking Patterns: Develop skills to modify the blinking rate by changing parameters in the code.

Expand Knowledge: Provide a foundation for more complex projects involving multiple LEDs, sensors, and other components.
